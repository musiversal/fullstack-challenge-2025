📚 Challenge Description

You will build a simple application to manage a list of songs, including:
	•	Listing existing songs.
	•	Adding new songs with an uploaded album cover image.
	•	Deleting songs.

You must build:
	•	A backend API with NodeJS and TypeScript.
	•	A frontend with ReactJS and TypeScript.
	•	Styling with TailwindCSS.

🛠️ Technical Requirements

Backend (NodeJS + TypeScript)
	•	Create a NodeJS server using Express, Fastify, or similar.
	•	Endpoints required:
	•	GET /songs → Return the list of songs.
	•	POST /songs → Add a new song (accepts an image file upload).
	•	DELETE /songs/:id → Delete a song by ID.
	•	Each song must contain:
	•	id: string
	•	name: string
	•	artist: string
	•	imageUrl: string (path to the uploaded album cover)
	•	Images must be:
	•	Uploaded and saved locally (e.g., /uploads folder).
	•	Served statically via the API.
	•	Data can be stored in memory (no database needed).
	•	Handle basic errors properly.
	•	Use proper TypeScript typing throughout the backend.

🔹 Hint: You may use libraries like multer for file uploads.

⸻

Frontend (ReactJS + TypeScript)
	•	Fetch and display the list of songs:
	•	Show song name, artist name, and album cover image.
	•	Create a form to add a new song:
	•	Inputs: song name (text), artist name (text), album cover image (file upload).
	•	Add a delete button to remove songs.
	•	Integrate and use TailwindCSS for basic layout and styling.
	•	Ensure basic loading indicators and error handling.
	•	Use React functional components and hooks.

Here is some wireframe:

Extra Credit (Optional)
	•	Add form validation (e.g., all fields required, max image size 2MB).
	•	Allow editing a song (optional PUT endpoint).
	•	API documentation (swagger) will be great
	•   Some simple tests to ensure you know what you are doing
	•	Deploy a working version (e.g., Vercel, Render) and share the live link.
