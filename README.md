üìö Challenge Description

You will build a simple application to manage a list of songs, including:
	‚Ä¢	Listing existing songs.
	‚Ä¢	Adding new songs with an uploaded album cover image.
	‚Ä¢	Deleting songs.

You must build:
	‚Ä¢	A backend API with NodeJS and TypeScript.
	‚Ä¢	A frontend with ReactJS and TypeScript.
	‚Ä¢	Styling with TailwindCSS.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

Backend (NodeJS + TypeScript)
	‚Ä¢	Create a NodeJS server using Express, Fastify, or similar.
	‚Ä¢	Endpoints required:
	‚Ä¢	GET /songs ‚Üí Return the list of songs.
	‚Ä¢	POST /songs ‚Üí Add a new song (accepts an image file upload).
	‚Ä¢	DELETE /songs/:id ‚Üí Delete a song by ID.
	‚Ä¢	Each song must contain:
	‚Ä¢	id: string
	‚Ä¢	name: string
	‚Ä¢	artist: string
	‚Ä¢	imageUrl: string (path to the uploaded album cover)
	‚Ä¢	Images must be:
	‚Ä¢	Uploaded and saved locally (e.g., /uploads folder).
	‚Ä¢	Served statically via the API.
	‚Ä¢	Data can be stored in memory (no database needed).
	‚Ä¢	Handle basic errors properly.
	‚Ä¢	Use proper TypeScript typing throughout the backend.

üîπ Hint: You may use libraries like multer for file uploads.

‚∏ª

Frontend (ReactJS + TypeScript)
	‚Ä¢	Fetch and display the list of songs:
	‚Ä¢	Show song name, artist name, and album cover image.
	‚Ä¢	Create a form to add a new song:
	‚Ä¢	Inputs: song name (text), artist name (text), album cover image (file upload).
	‚Ä¢	Add a delete button to remove songs.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate and use TailwindCSS for basic layout and styling.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure basic loading indicators and error handling.
	‚Ä¢	Use React functional components and hooks.

Here is some wireframe:

Extra Credit (Optional)
	‚Ä¢	Add form validation (e.g., all fields required, max image size 2MB).
	‚Ä¢	Allow editing a song (optional PUT endpoint).
	‚Ä¢	API documentation (swagger) will be great
	‚Ä¢   Some simple tests to ensure you know what you are doing
	‚Ä¢	Deploy a working version (e.g., Vercel, Render) and share the live link.
